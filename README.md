* The dataset utilized contains information on qualities of property, location of property, and time of sale in Sacramento, California in May of 2008

## Overview 

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Leveraging the .describe( ) method to produce notable findings and do necessary data clean-up 

### Plotting 
- Constructing scatter plots to identify possible predictors of price in SLR Model
- Showing relationship between indepenndent and dependent variables
- Selecting the best predictor to use as the independent variable in model building 

### Model Building 
- Defining X and y variables 
- Performing a train/test split
- Training SLR model using .fit( ) method 
- Making predictions using .predict( ) method 
- Grabbing and interperting model coefficient and intercept
